        React Router is a powerful library for handling navigation in React applications. 
        In this tutorial, we'll explore the basic concepts and advanced features that make 
        routing in React applications seamless and efficient.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        To get started with React Router, you first need to install the package:
        
        \`npm install react-router-dom\`
        
        ## Basic Setup
        
        The foundation of React Router lies in the BrowserRouter component, which provides 
        the routing functionality to your entire application.
        
        ## Advanced Features
        
        React Router offers many advanced features including:
        - Nested routing
        - Dynamic routes
        - Protected routes
        - Route guards
        - Navigation programmatically

        Advanced routing techniques can significantly improve the user experience 
        and structure of your React applications. Let's dive into some sophisticated 
        patterns and practices.
        
        ## Nested Routes
        
        Nested routes allow you to create complex layouts where different parts of 
        the UI are controlled by different route segments.
        
        ## Dynamic Routing
        
        Dynamic routing enables you to create routes that respond to variable 
        parameters, perfect for user-generated content.
        
        ## Route Protection
        
        Implementing authentication and authorization through protected routes 
        ensures secure access to sensitive areas of your application.

        Nested routes are one of the most powerful features of React Router. 
        They allow you to build complex user interfaces with multiple levels 
        of navigation.
        
        ## What are Nested Routes?
        
        Nested routes enable you to render child components within parent 
        components based on the URL structure.
        
        ## Implementation
        
        To implement nested routes, you use the Routes and Route components 
        within your parent component.
        
        ## Best Practices
        
        - Keep your route structure intuitive
        - Use meaningful URL segments
        - Implement proper error boundaries
        - Consider loading states
